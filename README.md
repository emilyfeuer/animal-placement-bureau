### Installation and Setup:

Before installing Django, you should first create a virtual environment. To do so, navigate to the chosen location of your project in a terminal and enter this command:

```
python -m venv venv
```

Now that you've made the virtual environment, you can use it with the below command. 

```
venv/Scripts/activate
```

At this point, you should see something like "(venv)" to the left in your terminal. Next, it's time to install Django in the virtual environment with this command:

```
pip install django
```

Now that you have Django installed, you can clone this project.
